### NEXT STEPS

1. What role gRNA takes in this pipeline? (Resolved)

2. How to determine a pair of primers is good? (Resolved)

3. What other functions should be considered in this pipeline?

4. Change parameters for primer design to get better primers.


#### Update 20201201 version 1.1

1. Expand max primer pairs return from 3 to 10

2. Regardless success or failure, show the primers 

3. In silico pcr, add condition, >100 and <-100 for guideseq

4. Correct the name from gRNA to guideseq
